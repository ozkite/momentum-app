# 🌊 Momentum: The Anti-Procrastination Mirror

**Stop Avoiding. Start Flowing.** Momentum is a high-stakes habit formation app built for the "New You." Unlike traditional trackers, Momentum targets the **friction of starting** by breaking down avoided tasks with AI and utilizing **Loss Aversion** through stablecoin staking.

&gt; Destroy procrastination. Stake on yourself. Win by doing.

Momentum is an anti-procrastination accountability platform that combines behavioral psychology (loss aversion) with micro-task generation to help users overcome starting friction on avoided tasks while building positive habits.

## 🎯 The Problem
Traditional to-do lists create anxiety. Habit trackers feel like chores. **Starting is the hardest part.**

## The Solution
1. **The Mirror**: Ask "What are you avoiding right now?" → AI breaks it into 5-minute micro-steps
2. **The Stake**: Bet $1+ weekly on yourself (higher stakes = more raffle tickets)
3. **The Raffle**: Complete goals → enter weekly raffles (coffee credits, cash prizes)
4. **The Loop**: Avoid bad habits (doom scrolling) by filling void with 20+ micro-achievements


   🚀 How It Works

    Identify Your Challenge: Tell the app what you're avoiding right now
    Break It Down: Get 5 micro-steps to start immediately
    Select Habits: Choose positive habits to build and negative ones to avoid
    Stake Your Commitment: Lock in a weekly amount (starting at $1)
    Track Progress: Check off completed habits throughout the day
    Earn Rewards: Complete goals to increase your chances in weekly raffles

   

## 🚀 The Core Loop
1. **The Mirror:** Tell the AI what you are avoiding. It gives you 5 micro-steps.
2. **The Micro-Habits:** Complete "Mind, Body, Spirit" tasks (Touch grass, breathe, stretch).
3. **Skin in the Game:** Stake $1+ per week. Complete your goals to enter the monthly $100+ Caffeine Raffle.
